		<h2><span>WMI</span><span class="slog">SPORTS</span> Terms of Service</h2><br> Thanks for using WMISPORTS. <br><br> 
		In order to use WMISPORTS you must accept these <u>Terms of Service</u>, 
		read them out loud with your hand over your heart, and swear to abide by them. <br><br>
		The WMISPORTS <u>Terms of Service</u> can be summed up nicely as your agreeing (and being an adult of 18+ years of age): <br><br>
		<b>1.) TO USE ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK</b>;<br><br>and:<br><br><b>2.) NOT TO USE OR ABUSE WMISPORTS FOR UNINTENDED OR EVIL PURPOSES</b>. <br><br>
		In regards to point #1, there is negligible risk in using WMISPORTS (assuming you don't use it to schedule the team of surgeons 
		for your emergency quadruple bypass; per second point, DON'T do that). The only information we ask for is your email address, so you're not 
		much at risk from identity theft; we promise not to reveal your email to anyone (show/sell/trade/etc.) — 
		if you're still paranoid, get yourself a throw-away address and live a little. We will also do our level best to keep the system running smoothly, 
		reliably, securely, and accurately. (Shit happens, but as rarely as we can manage.) Of course we would try and give as much advance notice as 
		possible, and avoid it entirely if at all possible... but we do also reserve the right to shut down the system or delete/suspend your account at any 
		time without notice. "AT YOUR OWN RISK" means you and your peeps (heirs, next of kin, family, relatives, guardians, conservators, executors, 
		administrators, trustees, and assigns) absolve WMISPORTS and its peeps (creators, affiliates, partners, associates, heirs, and offspring) 
		from liability for any and all damages arising from the use or misuse of WMISPORTS, howsoever caused. Bam. "Partners" includes sports leagues or 
		other organizations who may take part in WMISPORTS's "white-label" branding program by displaying their logo, name, or other brand information on
		WMISPORTS pages. <br><br>In regards to point #2, don't hack, harass, hate, or spam, and we won't delete your account. (We, in consultation with the 
		Almighty, reserve the right to decide what exactly constitutes "evil" — which might be hard to define, but we'll know it when we see it.)<br><br>
		There now, wasn't that painless? (And by penning this jaunty treatise ourselves, we just saved ourselves hundreds in legal fees. Bonus: and got 
		to use the words "jaunty" and "treatise".) <br><br>
